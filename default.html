                <p class="text1">I'm a great fan of science fiction books! Along with Fahrenheit by Ray Bradbury, I'm in love with his other works like:</p>
                    <ul type="circle" class="books">
                        <li>Dandelion Wine</li>
                        <li>The Halloween Tree</li>
                        <li>Farewell Summer</li>
                        <li>Most of Bradbury Short Stories (like A Sound of Thunder)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="text2">There are a lot of other gifted authors with their amazing works. For example, 
                if one happens to read Dune Chronicles by Frank Herbert, 
                they will never forget its futuristic setting and overwhelming plot twists unfolding on the majestic but merciless planet, Arrakis.
                Or you could always dive into thought-provoking ideas of Solaris, written by Stanislaw Lem.
                I love reading such books as they give you unforgetable experience of things that you perhaps could never imagine before! ⋆⁺₊⋆ ☾⋆⁺₊⋆</p>
